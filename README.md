# Unity Utils
A compilation of some useful Unity scripts I wrote.
## SavedData
A more comfortable (for me) way to use PlayerPrefs.
## Control
An alternative to the built-in input system, which allows keybinding. Requires SavedData.
## Sound
A sound controller and a cross-fade music player.
## Triggers
Allows you to reuse many scripts with an activated ability.
## Speech
Two speech controllers for different situations/games. Requires Sound and Triggers.
## Cutscene
An easy way to create cutscenes using Triggers. Requires Triggers.
